Feature: Localized contact reasons in embedded form
  In order to create embedded forms with localized contact reasons
  As an OroCRM admin
  I need to be able to create new embedded form and submit it with contact reason option selected

  Scenario: Add localization for contact reason
    Given I login as administrator
    And I enable the existing localizations
    Given I go to System/Configuration
    And follow "System Configuration/General Setup/Localization" on configuration sidebar
    And fill form with:
      | Default Localization | German_Loc |
    And submit form
    And I should see "Configuration saved" flash message
    And go to System/ Contact Reasons
    And I should see Want to know more about the product in grid with following data:

    And I click edit "Want to know more about the product" in grid
    And I click on "Contact Reason Form Label Fallbacks"

      | Label Second Use Default | false                                                     |
      | Label Second             | Want to know more about the product (German Localization) |
